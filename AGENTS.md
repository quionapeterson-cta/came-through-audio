- Keep metadata embedding in a browser-safe utility using browser-id3-writer; the uploader creates local MP3 downloads without changing catalog persistence or database permissions.
- Use shared semantic primary, accent and ring tokens for brand accents, so all controls follow the global theme.

- Paid access comes from Paddle webhook rows (subscriptions for yearly tiers, purchases for one-time buys) keyed by human-readable price IDs in src/lib/plans.ts; the client never writes them, so payment state cannot be forged.
- Staff roles live in public.user_roles (checked via is_staff/has_role); profile role/tier are trigger-protected from self-edits, so admin access cannot be self-granted. Admin reads go through staff-verified server functions.
- All outgoing email HTML must be wrapped with emailLayout() from src/lib/email-layout.ts — keeps branding and legal-footer compliance in one place.

## Writer Credits & Registration Rules (always follow)

### Core principle
Embedding is forgiving; registration is strict. Never block a user from saving or embedding a song because of incomplete writer info. Only block songs from entering registration sessions or agency exports.

### Writer data
- Every writer has: credited_name (required, stage names OK), legal_name (optional until registration), role.
- Roles are exactly: "Author", "Composer", "Author/Composer". Do not add, rename, or remove roles without asking.
- "Author/Composer" counts toward BOTH author and composer coverage everywhere: validation, catalog, exports, reports.
- Songs can have unlimited writers.
- Songs can be marked Instrumental, which removes the author requirement.

### Registration readiness (single source of truth)
- A song is "Ready" only when: (has an author OR is instrumental) AND has a composer AND every writer has a legal_name.
- This logic lives in ONE shared function/module. Every feature (embed indicator, catalog badge, export gate, any future agency template) must call it. Never re-implement readiness checks anywhere else.
- Readiness returns a list of specific missing items, not just true/false, so the UI can tell users exactly what to fix.

### Data flow
- Embed → Catalog → Agency export templates. Changes to writer fields must be carried through all three.
- Exports and registrations always use legal_name, never credited_name.
- When adding a new agency/PRO export template, it must use the shared readiness check and the existing writer fields. Do not create template-specific writer fields.

### UX conventions
- Missing writer info shows as a warning (⚠️) with a direct link to the field that needs fixing, never a dead-end error.
- Any new form field related to writers gets a help tooltip in plain language.

### Before making changes
- If a change touches writer fields, roles, readiness logic, or export templates, explain the plan and list affected files before editing.
- Never delete or overwrite existing writer data. Any schema change needs a migration that preserves current data.
